### Note
This implementation follows the pattern described in the official Gatsby documentation, but it is not exactly the same.

Specifically, the privateRoute component has been changed to follow the pattern suggested by the official React documentation.

### Note 2
This implementation should not be used in production. This example only illustrates the implementation on the frontend that can follow this pattern.
